        Look into the sky at the darkest point of night in an open space without any other light
        except red light. The stars dotting the night sky are beautiful, aren't they? The bad
        news is, the constellations or patterns of those stars are NOT  real. But how are they
        not real? This question is answered through studying light, the human eye and star 
        movement. But that is just the beginning. Outer space is no little thing. There are 
        billions of factors that go into the same thing, many of which humans don't even know 
        about. In later chapters, we will also talk about the expansion of the universe and bring
        a little of it then. Let's start small and start to get bigger and bigger.
