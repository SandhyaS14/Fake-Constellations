        <h1>Reference Notes b. (right)</h1>
        Not needed to explain. Only things are: distances are
        not exact on any of the diagrams and in order to make things go faster, we are using made up distances and star movement in context of movement speed of stars moving throughout space.

        <h3>Diagram 1</h3>
        <img src="Diagram 1.jpg">
        <br>
        <p>
            At any point of the explanations of every diagram, Regulus's light is always 2 (light)
            years closer to the Earth than Vega's. In this diagram, both Vega's and Regulus's 
            light traveled approximately 1/15 of one light year. One light is the avergae amount of
            distance light travels in one Earth year. That is approximately 24.35 days on Earth.
            Our scenario is that every star as well as the Earth all formed at the same time and
            all stars released light at the same time. it has been 24.35 days since the formation
            happened and the only star we se as of now is the Sun. 
        </p>

        <h3>Diagram 2</h3>
        <img src="Diagram 2.jpg">
        <br>
        <p>
            The light from both stars has traveled 2/15 of one light year. This is equivalent to
            48.70 days on Earth.
