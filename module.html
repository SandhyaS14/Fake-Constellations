        <h4>This page will be updated periodically, as subjects pertaining to Astronomy 
            are not easy to predict and what makes sense at one point may not make sense 
            without another point that hasn't been included. Click on Chapter 1.1 to go to first
            chapter. In order to reduce confusion, Please go in order of the chapters and 
            sections. If you have opened this website before, then you may go to where you left 
            off. Each section contains one set of diagrams. As of now, only 1.1 is being
            formed.
